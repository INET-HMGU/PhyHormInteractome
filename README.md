# PhyHormInteractome

This repository contains custom R-scripts for the analysis of the PhyHormInteractome network.

The R-scripts are for analyses of

- network communities
- GO enrichment in communities
- number of pathway contact points between different phytohormone pathways
- subsampling analysis of pathway contact points in PhyHormInteractome compared to interactome derived from IntAct and BioGRID database
- estimating sampling sensitivity of the yeast two hybrid screen.
